  To help me understand the level of protection offered by this: How do
  keyboards get identified? Would it be enough for a malicious device to have
  the same vendor ID and product ID as a keyboard that's trusted by the user?
  Since AFAIK these IDs are quite easy to fake, that would mean that this
  feature couldn't protect against a targeted attack (where the attacker has
  enough information about the victim). But of course it would still protect
  against other kinds of attacks.
