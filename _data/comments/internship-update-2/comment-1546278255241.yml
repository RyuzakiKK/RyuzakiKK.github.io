  I think this model still allows for a keylogger to be placed between the
  keyboard and PC without the user knowing.  Maybe an enhancement is possible
  here where if the keyboard is detached/reattached during lock, the user will
  be given a warning to check for the presence of a keylogger before entering
  their password?
