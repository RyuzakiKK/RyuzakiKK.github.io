  How about convertibles, like the 2-in-1 tablet I have. Where the keyboard by
  design is detachable? Would these have to be treated as an exception? When the
  keyboard dissapears, it just means it was disconnected, and in this case a
  foreign keyboard should probably be blocked if the device was locked in
  between.
