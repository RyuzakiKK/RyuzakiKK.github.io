message: "@ar This new keyboard notification is shown only if the screen is locked and you plug a keyboard.\r\n\r\nIf I correctly understood your use case, you are saying that it's common to plug an external monitor and that some of them also feature a USB hub (with a potential keyboard plugged).\r\nBut given the fact that the notification is only when you plug a keyboard while the session is locked, do you think that a gsettings entry may still be useful?"
