message: "Great initiatives, thank you for the contributions to GNOME\r\n\r\nFor the keyboard re-connect notification, are you adding a gsettings / dconf setting so it can be turned off? In some use-cases keyboard reconnection happens very often:  many monitors have a usb hub embedded (Dell Ultrasharp line for instance) meant to connect keyboard/mouse and share them (like a mini KVM) between two computers,  e.g. laptop and desktop. So the constant notification could get annoying for this type of use"
