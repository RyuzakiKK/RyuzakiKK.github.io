message: "I think everything posted made a lot of sense. However, think on this, what if you were to reate a \r\nkiller title? I mean, I don't want to tell you how to run your \r\nblog, however what if you added a post titfle that grabbed people's attention? I mean Keysign: Magic Wormhole refinements \r\nand initial Bluetooth implementation - de Nitis Ludovicoâ€™s blog is \r\nkinda boring. Yoou could glance at Yahoo's front page and note how they create post headlines to \r\ngrab viewers to open the links. You might add a related video or a pic or two to grab readers \r\nexcited about what you've written. Just my opinion, \r\niit mght make your website a little livelier."
